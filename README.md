## 🧠 What is BigMem?

**BigMem** is a Balatro mod focused on one thing: **performance**.

I made this mod because I play with **Jens Almanac Modpack for Balatro**, and after a while... things get chonky. Crashes, lag. BigMem dives into the internals of Lua math and some minor animation handling to lighten the load.

It’s my **first mod ever**, and while it works well in my testing, there’s always a chance it could:
- Break your other mods 💥
- Not work as intended ❓
- Summon digital gremlins 👾

Use at your own risk. Compatibility with other mods or hardware is **not guaranteed**.

## ⚙️ Features & Settings

BigMem gives you a whole config menu with toggles and options to fine-tune your experience.

### 🔬 Math Optimizations
Speed up heavy number crunching with approximations:

- ✅ `fastPow` – Optimized power function.
- ✅ `fastLog10`, `fastExp`, `fastSqrt`, and more!
- ✅ `memoization` – Caches expensive math results.
- ✅ Large number versions available (e.g., `fastPowLarge`).

You even get:
- `tetration`, `pentation`, `hexation`, `heptation`, `octation` — for those big brain exponential moments.

### 🎮 Visual Tweaks

- ✅ `reduceAnimations` – Fewer fancy effects = faster frames.
- ✅ `disableParticles` – Turns off particles.
- ✅ `limitFramerate` – Keeps your framerate reasonable (60/144/240/Unlimited).
- ✅ `hideDeck` and `hideConsumables` – Less stuff = less work.

### 🧪 Experimental Stuff

- 🧠 `enableBatching` – Batches calculations together.
- 💥 `fastBinomial`, `fastFibonacci`, `fastReciprocalSqrt`, and more!
- 🌈 `rainbowTint` – Tries to show a BRB message (currently doesn't work 🤷‍♂️).

## Introduction
BigMem is a Balatro mod focused on one thing: performance.

I made this mod because I play with Jens Almanac Modpack for Balatro, and after a while... things get chonky. Crashes, lag. BigMem dives into the internals of Lua math and some minor animation handling to keep things smooth.

Use at your own risk. Compatibility with other mods or hardware is not guaranteed.

## Features

### Math Optimizations
- **fastPow** ‚Äì Optimized power function.
- **fastLog10**, **fastExp**, **fastSqrt**, and more!
- **memoization** ‚Äì Caches expensive math results.
- Large number versions available (e.g., fastPowLarge).
- You even get:
  - tetration, pentation, hexation, heptation, octation ‚Äî for those big brain exponential moments.

### Visual Tweaks
- **reduceAnimations** ‚Äì Fewer fancy effects = faster frames.
- **disableParticles** ‚Äì Turns off particles.
- **limitFramerate** ‚Äì Keeps your framerate reasonable (60/144/240/Unlimited).
- **hideDeck** and **hideConsumables** ‚Äì Less stuff = less work.

### Experimental Stuff
- **enableBatching** ‚Äì Batches calculations together.
- **fastBinomial**, **fastFibonacci**, **fastReciprocalSqrt**, and more!
- **rainbowTint** ‚Äì Tries to show a BRB message (currently doesn't work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

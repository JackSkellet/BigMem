💾 BigMem - Performance Boost Mod for Balatro 🃏

⚡ Optimize your Balatro runs before the RAM monster crashes the party.

🧠 What is BigMem?
BigMem is a Balatro mod focused on one thing: performance.

I made this mod because I play with Jens Almanac Modpack for Balatro, and after a while... things get chonky. Crashes, lag. BigMem dives into the internals of Lua math and some minor animation handling to lighten the load.

It’s my first mod ever, and while it works well in my testing, there’s always a chance it could:

Break your other mods 💥
Not work as intended ❓
Summon digital gremlins 👾
Use at your own risk. Compatibility with other mods or hardware is not guaranteed.

⚙️ Features & Settings
BigMem gives you a whole config menu with toggles and options to fine-tune your experience.

🔬 Math Optimizations
Speed up heavy number crunching with approximations:

fastPow – Optimized power function.
fastLog10, fastExp, fastSqrt, and more!
memoization – Caches expensive math results.
Large number versions available (e.g., fastPowLarge).
You even get:

tetration, pentation, hexation, heptation, octation — for those big brain exponential moments.
🎮 Visual Tweaks
reduceAnimations – Fewer fancy effects = faster frames.
disableParticles – Turns off particles.
limitFramerate – Keeps your framerate reasonable (60/144/240/Unlimited).
hideDeck and hideConsumables – Less stuff = less work.
🧪 Experimental Stuff
enableBatching – Batches calculations together.
fastBinomial, fastFibonacci, fastReciprocalSqrt, and more!
rainbowTint – Tries to show a BRB message (currently doesn't work 🤷‍♂️).
